# Statistical Analysis Projects â€“ Course 6359 (Fall 2023)

This repository contains a series of statistical analysis projects completed as part of the coursework for STAT 6359 at UT Dallas during Fall 2023. Each project is implemented in R and covers a range of fundamental statistical concepts and data analysis techniques.

The assignments span hypothesis testing, data transformation, regression modeling, and visual interpretation of data. All analyses were performed using datasets provided in Excel or CSV format, with outputs generated in R and exported as CSV files where required.

The repository includes:

- **Homework Assignments (HW1 to HW3)**: 
  - Exploratory data analysis
  - Distribution modeling (Binomial, Poisson, Normal, t-distribution)
  - ANOVA and t-tests
  - Data transformation and skewness analysis

- **Bonus Assignment**: 
  - Data wrangling
  - Random number generation and filtering
  - Summary statistics and table operations

- **Test 3**: 
  - Two-factor ANOVA with interaction plots
  - Variance and mean testing between groups
  - Logistic regression for binary outcome prediction
  - Log transformation and confidence intervals
  - Chi-square test for independence

Each R script is self-contained and designed to read from its associated dataset, perform the analysis, and output the results accordingly.

This work reflects a hands-on application of statistical theory in R and demonstrates proficiency in both statistical reasoning and programming with real-world data.
